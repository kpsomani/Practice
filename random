You can unstage files from the index using

git reset HEAD -- path/to/file
Just like git add, you can unstage files recursively by directory and so forth, so to unstage everything at once, run this from the root directory of your repository:

git reset HEAD -- .
Also, for future reference, the output of git status will tell you the commands you need to run to move files from one state to another.
